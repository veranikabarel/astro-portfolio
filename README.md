## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```

├── public/

├── src/
|   ├── assets/
|   |   ├── images/

```

Astro looks for `.astro`, `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

`src/components/` is where we put any Astro components and similarly `src/layouts/` for layouts.

Images can be placed in `src/images/`.

Blog and documentation content are created as collections of Markdown or MDX files in `src/content`.

Any static assets, eg. images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command             | Action                                             |

| `yarn`              | Installs dependencies                              |
| `yarn dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`        |
| `yarn build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |
| `yarn preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying       |
| `yarn astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro preview` |
| `yarn astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                       |
